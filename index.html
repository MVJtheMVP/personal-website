    <h3 class = "aboutdes">I was born in Philadelphia and raised in 
      Omaha. I'm a highly motivated recent graduate from the 
      University of North Dakota. I recently graduated with a degree 
      in computer science, and I am excited to be a part of an innovative 
      company where I can continue to grow and develop as a software engineer. 
      I'm a team player, enjoy working with others, and am always eager to 
      take on new challenges. I'm open to relocation and am excited to see
       where my next chapter takes me!</h3>

      <h2>Education</h2>
    
    <h3 class="edudes">I attended The University of North Dakota, attaining a BS in Computer Science. Along with being a part of North Dakota's computer science program, I was on the football team. This unique experience allowed me to learn about programming languages, operating systems, and databases in the classroom and time management, accountability, and teamwork as a student-athlete.

          <h5>09/13/2021 - 5/14/2022</h5>
          <p>As a developer of "Zeus Game" (UND senior project), I undertook several vital responsibilities to revitalize the out-of-date 3D unity game. Working alongside a team of three members, we collaborated on designing, analyzing, and making crucial feasibility judgments. I completely reconstructed one of the game's levels and resolved issues by fixing deprecated methods and replacing missing assets. I taught myself various essential tools and technologies throughout the development process, including Unity, C#, Blender, and Plastic SCM.</p>

          <h5>06/20/2022 - 08/01/2022</h5>
          <p>At Tighten, I played a vital part in improving and streamlining Tighten's employee onboarding process. By carefully auditing the existing process, I identified and documented deprecated links and cataloged out-of-date information. Additionally, I conducted thorough research and composed detailed instructions on programming in Laravel for Windows users. Leveraging WSL2 using Docker (Sail), I successfully set up a Laravel project to run smoothly on Windows. Furthermore, I provided valuable assistance in creating a blog post targeted toward Windows users seeking guidance on the best technologies to kickstart their Laravel projects.</p>
