    <h3 class = "aboutdes">I was born in Philadelphia and raised in 
      Omaha Nebraska. Im a highly motivated recent graduate from the 
      University of North Dakota. I recently graduated with a degree 
      in computer science and I am excited to be a part of an innovative 
      company where I can continue to grow and develop as a software engineer. 
      I'm a team player and enjoy working with others and I'm always eager to 
      take on new challenges. I'm open to relocation and am excited to see
       where my next chapter takes me! </h3>

    <h3 class="edudes">I attended The University of North Dakota, attaining 
      a BS in computer science. Along with being a part of North Dakotas 
      computer science program I also was on the football team. This provided 
      me with a unique experience that gave me with the opportunity not to only 
      learn about programming languages, operating systems, and databases in the
       classroom, but to also learn about time management, accountability, and 
       teamwork as a student-athlete.

          <h5>09/13/2021 - 5/14/2022</h5>
          <p>"Zeus Game" is an adventure game that I worked on for 
            my senior project at UND. My team, consisting of three 
            other computer scientists and myself, were tasked with 
            getting the game into working order and adding enough 
            content for it to feel complete and be shown at UND's 
            end-of-the-year expo for computer scientists and engineers. 
            This project helped me develop skills in Unity, C#, version 
            control, and teamwork.</p>

          <h5>06/20/2022 - 08/01/2022</h5>
          <p>During my internship with Tighten Co., my main project was
             to help create a blog post aimed at onboarding Windows users 
             to Laravel. To achieve this, I used my Windows machine and WSL2 
             to create a Laravel project and performed database migration 
             using Docker Sail, Homestead, and Laragon, while documenting my 
             steps along the way. In this role, I developed skills in documentation, 
             HTML, CSS, PHP, Laragon, Git, and MySQL.</p>
